# Dad Jokes
I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”a playful site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages an API to deliver a daily dose of dad jokes, blending humor with tech. Every challenge was a lesson in creative problem-solving and coding resilience.
This project reminds me that innovation can be fun and light-hearted.
I'm thrilled to continue exploring the endless possibilities in web development. Let's keep coding with passion and a smile!
